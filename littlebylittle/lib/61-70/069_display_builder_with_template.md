## What's would we learn?

I way to combine the value(object contain diff values) we going to see with the template(HTML,CSV, or other parse template) we are using

* [example(Bad Approach)](069_display_builder_with_template.rb)

Basicly, the better approach using template design pattern as it own theory
and unified some of it own struct to be displayable, that's how those diff
objects could be show on diff templates.

using method missing make sure the value still be considered without making any
error

* [example(Better Approach)](069_display_builder_with_template_better.rb)
