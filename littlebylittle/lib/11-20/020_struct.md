###An Typical Ruby class definition

```ruby
class Point
  attr_accessor :x, :y
  def initialize(x=nil,y=nil)
    @x = x
    @y = y
  end
end
```

###Other Version: Struct

```ruby
point = Struct.new(:x, :y)
point # => #<Class:0x00000004da22e0>
point.class # => Class
point.name # => nil
```

in other words, Struct news a class that has no name.

we can give him name:
```ruby
Point = point
Point # => Point
point # => Point
point.class# => Class
point.name # => "Point"
```

It turns out that Ruby has a very special rule for when an anonymous class or module is assigned to a constant for the first time. 

When that happens, Ruby sets the name of the class or module to the name of the constant. This only happens once:

```ruby
Point = Struct.new(:x, :y)
Point                           # => Point
Location = Point
Location                        # => Point
```

##now that we have a Point class generated by Struct, what can we do with it?

####Well, we can instantiate Point objects:

```ruby
Point = Struct.new(:x, :y)
Point.new                       # => #<struct Point x=nil, y=nil>
Point.new(23)                   # => #<struct Point x=23, y=nil>
Point.new(5,7)                  # => #<struct Point x=5, y=7>
```

####We can also get and set the x and y attribute values.
```ruby
p = Point.new(4,5)
p.x                             # => 4
p.y                             # => 5
p.x = 7
p.x                             # => 7
 
```
####We can also get and set values using Hash-like subscript syntax. 
```ruby
p = Point.new(4,5)
p[:x]                           # => 4
p["y"]                          # => 5
p[:x] = 13                      
p.x                             # => 13
```

####We also get the equality operator for free

```ruby
Point = Struct.new(:x, :y)
Point.new(5,3) == Point.new(5,3) # => true
Point.new(5,3) == Point.new(3,5) # => false
```

####structs can introspect(内省,内观) and iterate over their attributes<Paste>

```ruby
p = Point.new(3,5)
p.members #=> [:x,:y]
p.each do |value|
	puts value
end
p.each_pair do |name, value|
	puts "#{name}: #{value}"
end

# >> 3
# >> 5
# >> x: 3
# >> y: 5

```
####To top it off, structs include Enumerable
```ruby
p = Point.new(3,5)
p.max                           # => 5
p.reduce(&:+)                   # => 8
```

####Here’s a custom #to_s method for our Point class.

```ruby
Point = Struct.new(:x,:y) do
	def to_s
		"#{x}x#{y}"
	end
end
Point.new(3,5).to_s # => "(3x5)"
```
