## 2 versions of error that different team want to throw:

* [2 types of errors](038_fallback.rb)

## How to resolve issue: **when in doubt, punt the decision somewhere else.**

* [resolve the issue](038_fallback_specified.rb)
* [resolve the issue](038_fallback_specified1.rb)

## the same idea of [resolve the issue](038_fallback_specified1.rb) is apply for fetch

```ruby
{foo: 42}.fetch(:bar) {"Not Found"} #=> "Not Found"
```
