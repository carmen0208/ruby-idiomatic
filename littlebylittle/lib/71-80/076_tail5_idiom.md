### Refactoring the code to be more rubise

* Making a method to passing a variable as well as a block. 
* The block would be the inner while, it's a good way to separate(differentiate) the inner loop
  form the outer one
* encapsulation the block into an other methods. yield as needed. 

### 077, WORKING on how to makes it as a OOP

* I can't explain the whole idea, I can only understand a little, I would put it
  to //TODO list to read it again

  //TODO 077_tail6_process_as_object.rb
