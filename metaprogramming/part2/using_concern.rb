#This is a hard piece of code to wrap your brain around,
# but its basic idea is simple: never include a concern in another concern.
# Instead, when concerns try to include each other,
# just link them in a graph of dependencies.
# When a concern is finally included by a module that is not itself a concern,
# roll all of its dependencies into the includer in one fell swoop.

#First, you must add yourself to that chain of ancestors,
# by calling the standard Module.append_features with super.
# Finally, donâ€™t forget what this entire machinery is for:
# you have to extend the includer with your own ClassMethods module,
# like the include-and-extend trick does. You need Kernel#const_get to get
# a reference to ClassMethods, because you must read the constant from the
# scope of self, not the scope of the Concern module,
# where this code is physically located.
